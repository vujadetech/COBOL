I am under the FPL (federal poverty line) with my current PUA (Pandemic Unemployment Assistance). Given the amount of uncertainty surrounding the economy, which is at risk of collapsing under the weight of 25% (and counting) unemployment, and given that there are ample opportunities for self-study that are free (e.g. Hercules emulator), it would be ill-advised to pay for a class like this at this time. In fact, whenever I hear corporations and government agencies bemoaning the skills shortage in areas like mainframes/COBOL/etc, I have to wonder why they make it difficult for interested parties to undertake their own studies and experiments. Languages like Python and Java and operating systems like Linux would not be nearly as popular, perhaps not even extant, had they taken a similar approach. ... And now I've been informed that my explanation must be at least 150 words. The initial explanation was not sufficiently verbose, is that what you are to have me believe? Well, beggars can't be choosers, can they? So here we are, what shall we do to fill the void? Ah, I'll share with you this paraphrase of a famous saying by punning it with my own last name: "There but for the grace of God, Igoe."
