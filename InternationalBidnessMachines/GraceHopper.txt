To paraphrase Mark Twain, "The reports of the mainframe's death have been greatly exaggerated." The New Jersey unemployment claims processing debacle illustrates that this is just the canary in the coalmine. It's peculiar how the word "legacy" is only used in the pejorative sense in IT, whereas it's used positively elsewhere. Obama claimed in 2016 that if black voters wouldn't put Hilary in Office, he would take it as a personal insult. Electing Trump would be a blot on his escutcheon as it would tarnish the legacy he had so meticulously curated during his eight years in Office as America's first black President. In a similar fashion, it would tarnish the legacy of Rear admiral Grace Hopper - may the Lord rest her beautiful soul - if humanity botches this opportunity to redress the creaking ship that modern legacy (oxymoron fully intended) systems have become when what's at stake is so vividly illustrated and eloquently articulated by NJ Governor Phil Murphy.
