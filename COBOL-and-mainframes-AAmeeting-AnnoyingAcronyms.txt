However encyclopedic the knowledge of a COBOL cowboy who comes <galloping in on his stallion /strikethrough> hobbling in with his walker, it won't be enough. 

What about office culture? What's an apple-cheeked millenial* to do during an awkward pause with Ma and Pa Kettle at the water cooler? (Just smile and nod if one of them makes a Woody Herman reference.) 

* The oldest millenials are now 40. 

What 

What, they can hack into the FBI, CIA, they can remotely launch a NASA rocket over a dial-up modem, but 

Can we hire one of these kids to do this for us? Give him a prison furlough if he's locked up for a previous hacking conviction. Hell, he might already be up for a COVID-related early release if he's a non-violent offender.  And while were at it, 
Where's a labor-wreckin' robot when you need one? 
You know, if we asked nicely. 
All , 
we can't get a freakin' COBOL mainframe in New Jersey to print unemployment checks? Are you f***in' KIDDing me?!? 

But I digress...

Software engineering is a difficult subject.

Finally, the people of the State of New Jersey itself. 
Don't teach that homeless guy how to build an app. Teach him COBOL! 
And not just Jersey. 

Teaching javascript to african immigrants? [clip of troll TED talk Sam Hyde?] No, we're teaching _COBOL_ to African immigrants! 

[CA DMV migrating from assembly] 
Assembly language is per se difficult to write and maintain. COBOL isn't. 
Avoiding COBOL is like avoiding brussel sprouts. Completely understandable, but a bad idea in the long run. Part of the reason we're in this mess is that we won't to eat our vegetables.

Gov Schwarzenegger has a message for you COBOL fearing girly-men: You lack discipline!
